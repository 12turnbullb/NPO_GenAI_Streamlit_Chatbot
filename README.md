# Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

Welcome to the **Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock** repository! This collection of Python scripts serves as a guide to help you understand and implement generative artificial intelligence using Amazon Bedrock. Each script focuses on different aspects of generative AI, showcasing practical examples and providing step-by-step explanations.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Set up Cloud9 development environment**
   Follow the instructions on [this workshop](https://catalog.workshops.aws/building-with-amazon-bedrock/en-US/prerequisites/cloud9-setup) to setup the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment.

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-amazon-bedrock.git
   cd generative-ai-amazon-bedrock
   ```
3. **install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Note:** Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed before proceeding with the examples.

## Set up AWS Credentials

Ensure that you have your AWS credentials set up properly. If you don't have them, you can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to configure your AWS CLI.
